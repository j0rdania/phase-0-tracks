<!-- Release 4 Reflections - Jordan:
HTML5 semantic tags have several purposes:
a. they can be helpful to someone reading your code because they communicate what you are trying to do with a section of code
b. they can be helpful for people with disabilities because people with special needs use software that parses the html and delivers the content in an alternate way (i.e. a reader)
c. by including semantic tags, entries in an associated CSS file can be used to style and format the information within the tags
The HTML5 semantic tags that I see as most useful are:
a. the p tag - creates a paragraph with space between it and other content
b. the heading tags (<h1> through <h6>) - important because it allows you to specify font, color, etc. for different types of headings
c. the section tag <section> - it identifies a section of a page (i.e. a chapter of an article). it has a heading, and it is a logical unit of the page - very useful for positioning, etc.
  The browser, by default, will display the elements of a page in the order they are listed in the html document. However, the CSS file(s) can override the default order to move things to different positions, etc. In the case of a conflict  (i.e. there is an h1 header for a section but an h2 header for an article within that section), the most specific entry will be used (in this case, the article's header would be used because the article is within the section). I was just doing a little research, and it looks like the browser goes through a complicated process of creating a DOM tree, which seems to be a graphical representation of the logical structure. It seems to start at the top, and it needs to reference any CSS files and javascript. It looks like a complicated process to coordinate all of the different inputs, download the needed information, and render the page.
  In this session, I learned about the sublime snippets. I learned to accept the default "save as" location when saving a snippet. I actually created my own snippet to load the basic html (my default behavior has somehow been overridden because a previous pair had recommended installing some packages such as Emmit and package control - or something like that). Anyway I was able to restore the simple functionality. At first, I made the tab trigger "html", just like before, but when I tested it, the one from the package was still firing. So, instead, I named the new one "html_basic", and now it is working like a charm. I can see how the snippet feature will be really useful, once I start having a favorite way to create repeating chunks of html. I think I am going to like snippets! I am curious about those packages that were installed. They have nice features such as a "beautify" feature that cleans up html indenting, etc., but I am little worried that they might screw something up.
  The most difficult concept in this challenge was actually the preparation phase. I ran into a github issue, even though this was a really simple thing. I think I started to make changes on my master branch (without creating a feature branch). Then, I realized my error and had to figure out how to back out of it. I ran into another confusing situation when I did a git status and, rather than the index.html file showing as modified (what I would have expected), I got "./". I did a git add -A, and that seemed to work. I still don't understand what that "./" meant, but our guide speculated that it means that git was having issues determining what had changed, probably due to directories being moved around or perhaps files being created outside of the repo and then moved in. I learned some helpful tips from our guide about when to create new branches vs. just committing, pushing, and continuing with the same branch. I also learned that it is smart to do a git push after you've done a commit, since it will keep it safe in the cloud, and it will also serve as a communication method to others on my team so they can see my progress. -->
