  <h1>Jordan's Thoughts on Pizza</h1>

  <p><strong>I like pizza. It is so tasty. When I bite into it, my mouth is filled with happiness.</strong> </p>

  <p> I first made my own pizza when I was a teenager. I would invite all of my friends over, and we would make our own dough and create individual pizzas with different toppings.</p>

  <h2><p> Steps to make pizza:</h2>
  <ol>
      <li> make the dough</li>
      <li> knead the dough</li>
      <li> form the dough into a circle, <em>tossing it in air</em></li>
      <li> put on pizza pan and add toppings</li>
      <li> bake it at 400 degrees for 12 minutes</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <h2><p>Sample pizza toppings:</h2>
  <ul>
      <li> tomato sauce</li>
      <li> cheese</li>
      <li> sausage</li>
      <li> pineapple</li>
      <li> onions</li>
  </ul>
