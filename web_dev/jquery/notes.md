 jQuery

 Plan:
 What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

 1. find (using Google) and read an overview or two of jQuery - take notes, making a list of common tasks jQuery can help with
 2. look at javascript/jQuery book that i bought earlier - read/skim jQuery material, taking notes
 3. figure out if jQuery needs to be installed (and do it, if so). Look at previous notes b/c I think I've used it once before and I think you need to reference it at the top of the javascript program.
 4. Make a super simple jQuery call and test it. Best to start super small and make sure I have things set up right.
 5. until 2-hour time limit is up, try using jQuery to help with tasks listed in step 1. Test each one along the way, and experiment with different options if they look interesting.

 I found the w3schools.com tutorial for jQuery to be the most effective. I like having a new topic introduced step by step. Starting small worked out great. I was able to make my jQuery call work after just a few syntax fixes. I was able to use the document ready event suggested in the tutorial so that the jQuery code wouldn't run until the page had finished loading.
