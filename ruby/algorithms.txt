Algorithm for Using an Elevator

a. As you stand outside the elevator door, think about  the floor number that you’d like to go to.
b. Look around to determine what floor you are currently on. If you don’t see a floor number on the wall, ask a friendly nearby receptionist. 
c. If your current floor is equal to your desired floor, don’t use the elevator.
d. If your current floor is greater than your desired floor, you want to go down.
e. If your current floor is less than your desired floor, you want to go up.
f. If you want to go up, press the button with the up arrow. If you’d rather go down, press the button with the down arrow.
g. When the elevator door opens in front of you, look at the light next to the door. If it is pointing in the direction that you want to go, step into the elevator. Otherwise, wait. Repeat this step until an elevator going in your chosen direction opens in front of you.
h. Now you are in the elevator. If there are people in there with you, space yourself out so you are standing equidistant from all people in the elevator. Stare awkwardly at the floor and pretend there are no other people in the elevator with you.
i. Think about the floor number that you want to go. If there is a person blocking the panel with the numbers on it, ask them to press the button with that number for you. Otherwise, press it yourself.
j. Each time the elevator doors open, look at the wall next to the elevator door. There should be a number there indicating the floor of the building you are on. If that number matches your desired floor number, step out of the elevator. If not, stay in the elevator and repeat this step until you arrive at your floor and step out of the elevator.
k. As you step out, if there are any people still in the elevator, smile, and wish them a good day.
